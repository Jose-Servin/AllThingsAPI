# BEM CSS Methodology

* BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a CSS methodology and naming scheme.

* With BEM, you almost exclusively use `classes` and limit other selectors. This is done to help with specificity.

## Blocks

Blocks are meaningful, standalone entities and follow the single word naming convention or `some-element` convention.

For example, our Block elements are:

```css
.header{

}

.form {

}

.menu{

}
```

## Elements

Elements are parts of a block. This means their meaning is tied to a block and are named using the element name + double underscore.

```css
.header__logo{

}

.form__field{

}

.menu__item{

}
```

## Modifiers

Modifiers are a variant of the basic styles for a block or element. The naming convention used here is the double hyphen `--`.

```css

.menu__item--selected{

}
```
